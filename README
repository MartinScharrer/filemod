The filemod Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Copyright (C) Martin Scharrer <martin@scharrer-online.de>

This package provides macros to read and compare the modification dates
of files. These files can be .tex files, images or other files as long as they can be
found by the LaTeX compiler. It uses the \pdffilemoddate primitive of pdfLaTeX
to receive the file modification date as PDF date string, parses it and returns
the value to the user.
The functionality is provided by purely expandable macros or by faster but non-expandable ones.

This package will work with LaTeX and plain eTeX as long pdf(La)TeX (in
PDF or DVI mode) or Lua(La)TeX is used. Xe(La)TeX is not supported because it
does not provide \pdffilemoddate.

Examples:
    % Prints file modification date and time of main file
    \filemodprint{\jobname}

    % Include newest of a set of files:
    \input{\filemodNewest{{file1}{file2}{file3}}}

    % Include newest of a set of images:
    % (\includegraphics doesn't expand its fully before parsing it)
    \FilemodNewest{{file1}{file2}{file3}}
    \includegraphics{\filemodresultfile}
