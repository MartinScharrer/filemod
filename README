The filemod Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Copyright (C) Martin Scharrer <martin@scharrer-online.de>
Version v1.0 -- 2011/03/23

This package provides macros to read and compare the modification dates
of files. These files can be .tex files, images or other files as long as they can be
found by the LaTeX compiler. It uses the \pdffilemoddate primitive of pdfLaTeX
to receive the file modification date as PDF date string, parses it and returns
the value to the user. This package will also work for DVI output with recent
versions of the LaTeX compiler which uses pdfLTEX in DVI mode. The functionality
is provided by purely expandable macros or by faster but non-expandable ones.

Examples:
    % Prints file modification date and time of main file
    \filemodprint{\jobname}

    % Include newest of a set of files:
    \input{\filemodNewest{{file1}{file2}{file3}}}
